In addition give summary with 200 characters in length. Use BBCode for formatting. Whole article should be between [table]  [/table] and line breaks should be like:
  [tr][td]Sample Text message -next1 break[/td][/tr]
  [tr][td] [/td][/tr]
    
    Do not include any html code in artice or summary.
